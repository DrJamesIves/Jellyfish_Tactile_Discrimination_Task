% Presents gated tactile stimuli to left and right tactors simultaneously.
% Each stimulus is presented at different intencities, which translate to
% different intensities. These intensities start far apart and east to
% discriminate and become closer together as participant answers correctly.

% Important!! In this version of the tactors scripts the tactors audio
% comes directly from the mac and must be plugged into the audio jack.
% This is because the audio is not constant but instead controlled by the
% audio output.

% v5 runs with eye tracking
% v4 implements a fixation/trial structure
% v3 first stable version
