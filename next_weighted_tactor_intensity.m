% Uses a weighted 2 up 1 down staircase to calculate the next set of intensities
% to be differentiated. Starts with a high instensity difference. Tracks trial tact_hist 
% and whether the response is correct. Adjusts the intensityuencies accordingly, bringing 
% them closer (harder) after correct trials, and farther apart (easier) after incorrect ones.
% Uses weighted steps, meaning two corrects are needed to go down (harder), and one 
% incorrect bumps it back up (easier), with asymmetric step sizes if needed.

% If the first trial then use the default settings so no calc needed
